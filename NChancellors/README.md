This group project was developed for a project in CMSC 142 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)

We were asked to create an N-Chancellors puzzle game that implements backtracking to display possible solutions. 
We added a Christmas theme to it just because.

To run the Game, just open game.html to any browser and start playing. The objective of the game is to
be able to place N gifts on the grid, N = size of a row or column
