**** Please note that as of 1/25/2018, all Unity Games are still subject to update,
I just completed the minimum requirements for the game as described in the Udemy Course 
(Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer Course) I bought. 
I intend to add more features to all my games (responsiveness, more player/enemy sprites, power ups,
score dashboard, etc.) once I have completed the course. (Expected completion: 2/18/2018)

*** If you intend to run the code, please download:
	<Game Name>.exe <-- Just double click this file with the 2 files below in the same directory and it should work
	UnityPlayer.dll
	<Game Name>_Data folder

-There is a similar game in my portfolio (SpaceInvaders), that one was developed using Javascript. It was part of a 
requirement during my application process for a gaming company
