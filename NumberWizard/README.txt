**** Please note that as of 1/25/2018, all Unity Games are still subject to update,
I just completed the minimum requirements for the game as described in the Udemy Course 
(Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer Course) I bought. 
I intend to add more features to all my games (responsiveness, more player/enemy sprites, power ups,
score dashboard, etc.) once I have completed the course. (Expected completion: 2/18/2018)

*** If you intend to run the code, please download:
	<Game Name>.unity <-- Just double click this file with the 2 files below in the same directory and it should work
	UnityPlayer.dll
	<Game Name>_Data folder

-This was just an introductory exercise to Unity scripting, and Canvas UI Events
-When playing, think of a number, then click "start". A number will be shown on the screen,
 click on the "Higher", "Lower", or "Correct" button if one choice corresponds to your number.
 The game only gets 5 tries.
