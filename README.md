*UNITY GAMES 

all Unity Games are still subject to update,
I just completed the minimum requirements for the game as described in the Udemy Course 
(Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer Course) I bought. 
I intend to add more features to all my games (responsiveness, more player/enemy sprites, power ups,
score dashboard, etc.) once I have completed the course. (Expected completion: 2/18/2018)
