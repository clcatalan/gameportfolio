This game was developed as a work test for a company that I applied to

to run the game, open index.html in firefox (images from the sprites wont work in chrome due to its security features)
click on a ship of your choice, then start game, once you're in the game, click on your ship again to trigger the
falling of the enemies, move your mouse to control your ship's movement, and left click to shoot missiles
